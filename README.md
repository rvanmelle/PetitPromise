# PetitPromise

Toy promise implementation in swift. This should not be used in production code. On the other hand, the basics do work and it is single file drop-in. It could be useful as a starting point for your own custom implementation.

I realized that in day-to-day production coding, I don't get to exercise the functional part of my brain nearly often enough. I wanted to write a very simple but working Promise implementation.


# ToDo List

- more tests
- finish and write tests for LazyPromise and decide whether it is useful
- classic extras: Promise.all, race, map, any, zip, -- 
- other patterns: https://www.promisejs.org/patterns/
